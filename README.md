# DiamondCoder
Last week, I failed to "fight" for the "Unknown Heraldry" in Honkai Impact 2. So I hid my tears of anger and started to store the diamonds. I've had a good idea to encourage myself and to help me walk out of the abyss, that is, to encode the number of diamonds and add it to my account name to remind me of my "Genki" stored. The method to encode is only to change the base of a number to 34. That's easy, isn't it? And why 34? That's my luckiest number!!!
